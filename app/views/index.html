        Incident Management & Resilience Local Outcome Plan 2020-2025
      </h1>
        <<p class="govuk-body-l">
          This Local Outcome Plan sets out how the Incident Management & Resilience (IM&R) team will deliver the strategic goals set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-ea2025-creating-a-better-place/environment-agency-ea2025-creating-a-better-place" class="govuk-link">EA action plan (EA2025)</a>. It outlines our aspirations and objectives for the next 5 years.
        </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
      
      <p>Incident management keeps people sage and protects the environment from serious and lasting damage.</p>

      <p>By 2025, we will be prepared and ready for the emergencies we will face, inspire people to action and be the brilliant responder we aspire to be.</p>
    
      <p>Now more than ever we need to change ourselves, our ways of working and take the initiative to do things differently.</p>

      <p>This plan is for all of IM&R to own and champion. I hope you will join me and the Leadership Team to bring this plan to life and really make a difference to incident management across the EA.</p>
        
      <p>To IM&R - it is in all our hands to action.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="challenges">Challenges we face</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Increasing environmental risk</h3>
      <p>We are in a climate emergency. Natural systems are reacting to higher temperatures, more intense rainfall and prolonged periods of dry weather. As a result we see bigger, more frequent environmental incidents.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        Climate scientists estimate that there could be up to 59% more precipitation in winters by 2050.
      </div>

      <p>The infrastructure that supports our society wasn’t designed for these new extremes and increased pressure on it has the knock-on effect of further, more complex incidents.</p>

      <p>Our changing environment disrupts society and forces economic instability which threatens the sustainability of our nation and stresses our incident management service.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        There is a 1 in 4 chance over the next 30 years that water supplies will be cut off for extended periods because of drought.
      </div>

      <p>We need to understand and address these pressures so we can be confident we can help keep people safe, protect the environment and deliver our critical business activities.</p>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">An economy under pressure</h3>
      <p>Climate change, the Covid-19  pandemic and the subsequent economic challenges, combined together could result in increasing damage to the environment and risks to lives and livelihoods. An increase in incidents can occur as environmental compliance is less of a priority as financial  pressure on businesses grows. Incidents are costly but good incident management can save money.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        The 2005 Buncefield fuel storage depot explosion led to fines and costs in excess of £10 million: the estimated environmental damage was 100 times this amount.
      </div>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Increasing population with higher expectations</h3>
      <p>Public expectation is high. People know we are good at incident management and rely on us to keep them safe and look after their environment.We live in a digital age with real-time information and an expectation that government will provide real-time answers.</p>

      <p>From reviews such as the Pitt Review in 2008, or the more recent Grenfell Inquiry, there is a constant desire to minimise risk, be more effective in future incidents and help communities to recover quickly.</p>

      <p>Population growth means bigger demands on water and sewerage systems whilst new homes push into green spaces, contaminated brownfield sites and the floodplain. This adds to the challenge.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">A service at risk of being overwhelmed</h3>
      <p>Our Incident  Management Service has evolved in response to increasing demands, organisational changes and funding challenges. We rely on a substantial amount of legacy IT and a volunteer model to fulfil incident roles. We trust our great people to balance the demands of incident response alongside their other responsibilities.</p>

      <p>As the number of incidents increases this affects our ability to deliver other aspects of core Environment Agency work. Ironically this increases risk of incidents as our work to prevent  incidents lessens.</p>

      <p>All of this is compounded by funding constraints. Since 2015, our Grant in Aid  revenue funding has dropped by 17%. We have achieved a lot of savings by being efficient but it has reduced our service.</p>
