      </h1>
        <p class="govuk-body-s">
          This Local Outcome Plan sets out how the Incident Management & Resilience (IM&R) team will deliver the strategic goals set out in the EA action plan (EA2025). It outlines our aspirations and objectives for the next 5 years.
        </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Foreword</h2>
      
      <p>Incident management keeps people sage and protects the environment from serious and lasting damage.</p>

      <p>By 2025, we will be prepared and ready for the emergencies we will face, inspire people to action and be the brilliant responder we aspire to be.</p>
    
      <p>Now more than ever we need to change ourselves, our ways of working and take the initiative to do things differently.</p>

      <p>This plan is for all of IM&R to own and champion. I hope you will join ne amd the IM&R Leadership Team to bring this plan to life and really mak a difference to incident management across the EA.</p>
        
      <p>To IM&R - it is in all our hands to action.</p>
